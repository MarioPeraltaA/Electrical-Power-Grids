## Electrical Power Networks Analysis: network`y`.py

#### Electrical Networks Analysis
### Python Module to Identify Topology Inconsistencies in Power Grids Automatically

Due to the necessity in the electrical sector of having a tool to clean up automatically the electrical network so that its electrical model can be built up using tools such as *OpenDSS* or *CYME*. The module `networky.py` is an effort to detect, recognize and finally identify network irregularities and inconsistencies in the power electrical sector either Transmission or Distribution by verifying connections consistency, presence of multiple components, islands, forests, clouds, self-loops, cycles and more. Its software design is base on Abstract Classes so that multiple clients could make its own implementation of such interface.
